Here's the current process on my Mac for making changes to ReL and running the new ReL on AWS:

cd /Users/pcannata/Mine/MyReL
if I start with "ant clean", which is only for major changes like putting new files into extlibs:
    ant
    cp the site-packages foled onto dist/Lib
otherwise, just type ant
send dist.zip to trash
create dist.zip
scp -i /Users/pcannata/Mine/P4/p4ds-key-pair-uswest2.pem dist.zip ec2-user@ec2-52-10-0-189.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:Phil

// Now go at AWS
ssh -i /Users/pcannata/Mine/P4/p4ds-key-pair-uswest2.pem ec2-user@ec2-52-10-0-189.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
cd Phil/
rm -rf dist
unzip dist.zip
pkill -9 java
nohup dist/bin/jython RestfulReL/mike68561-restful-rel-ea5e3cef544e/restful_start.py &
tail -f nohup.out

// I test it from RStudio running the following:

q <- "WHERE"
r <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('ec2-user@ec2-52-10-0-189.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5001/rest/native/?query="SELECT ?s ?p ?o  "(lambda x: x)(q)" {?s ?p ?o .}"'), httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDB1.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal',USER='DV_Diamonds',PASS='orcl',MODE='ag_rdf_mode',MODEL='model',returnDimensions = 'False',returnFor = 'JSON', q=q),verbose = TRUE)))

(  Just for fun, I put a python lambda expression into the query, which gets evaluated by ReL before the query is passed to AG)

This can be streamlined when we can do development on AWS but I have to reconfigure the repo to add more users before we can do that.

Next step is to get results returned through ReL.
